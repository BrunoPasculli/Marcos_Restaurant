# Marcoâ€™s Restaurant

## Introduction
A friend of mine, Marco, opened a new restaurant in town last month. His specialty is all kinds of pasta. After the first month, he asks for help because he can't analyze by himself all the data he has taken from his new business.
So, as a first approach, you want to use the data to answer some simple questions about your customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they have spent and also which menu items are their favorites. In this way, you could establish an even deeper connection with your customers, which would help you better understand their needs and offer them a personalized experience.
